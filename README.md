## Overview
Information hub of organizations events/meetings in a specific univeristy/college.

### Description
Allows students and student leaders of clubs and organizations to create events and post meeting information. Connects students to their peers with similar interests and allows them to find events that fit their schedule and save them to a calendar.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Educational/Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for iOS.
- **Story:** Shows university events from clubs, organizations, and individuals at the university. Students can connect to others and post comments
- **Market:** University Students. Users need a school email to register.
- **Habit:** Students can use the app as often as they want to connect to others or when they are bored and looking for events to participate in with other students.
- **Scope:** Students at our schools (Texas State University and City College of San Francisco). Then we would expand to all students with .edu email addresses.
